Create a professional, modern, and fully responsive personal portfolio website for a candidate applying for internships and jobs in data science, data analysis, and business analysis. The website should be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website's design should be clean, minimalist, and professional, using a dark mode theme. The primary color palette should be a dark gray or charcoal background (e.g., #121212), white or light gray text (e.g., #EAEAEA), and a single accent color like a professional blue (e.g., #007BFF) or green (e.g., #28a745) for links, buttons, and highlights. Use a clean, sans-serif font like 'Poppins' or 'Lato' imported from Google Fonts.

The website must be a single-page layout with a fixed navigation bar at the top that smoothly scrolls to the corresponding sections. The sections should be in this specific order: Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

Here are the detailed requirements for each section:

1.  Fixed Navigation Bar:
* Positioned at the top of the page.
* Should have a semi-transparent background that becomes solid on scroll.
* Links: "Home", "About", "Skills", "Projects", "Contact".
* The active section link in the navbar should be highlighted.

2.  Home Section (Hero Section):
* This should be the first thing visitors see.
* Include a main heading with the text: Hi, I'm [Your Name].
* A sub-heading that says: Aspiring Data Scientist & Analyst.
* Include an animated typing effect for the subheading or a list of roles like "Data Analyst | Business Analyst | Data Scientist".
* A call-to-action button that says "View My Projects" which smoothly scrolls to the Projects section.
* Include professional social media icons with links for LinkedIn and GitHub.

3.  About Section:
* A heading that says About Me.
* A two-column layout.
* Left column: A circular placeholder for a professional headshot/photo.
* Right column: A brief bio (3-4 sentences). Use this placeholder text: "I am a passionate and analytical problem-solver with a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and data visualization. I am eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting to extract valuable insights from data and contribute to data-driven decision-making. My goal is to leverage data to uncover trends and solve complex business challenges."
* Below the bio, include a "Download Resume" button. This button should link to a PDF file named resume.pdf that I will upload.

4.  Skills Section:
* A heading that says Technical Skills.
* Use icons or logos for each skill, displayed in a grid layout.
* Organize skills into categories with subheadings:
* Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL
* Data Science & ML: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
* Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
* Tools: Git, Docker, Excel

5.  Projects Section:
* A heading that says My Projects.
* Display projects as a series of cards in a responsive grid.
* Create three placeholder project cards.
* Each card must have:
* An image placeholder at the top.
* Project Title (e.g., "Sales Dashboard Analysis").
* A short description (2-3 sentences).
* "Tags" for technologies used (e.g., Python, Pandas, Tableau).
* Two link buttons: "View Code" (linking to GitHub) and "Live Demo" (if applicable).
* When a user hovers over a project card, it should have a subtle shadow or lift effect.

6.  Contact Section:
* A heading that says Get In Touch.
* Include a simple statement like: "I'm currently seeking new opportunities. Please feel free to reach out!"
* Display my email address clearly.
* Include a simple, functional contact form with fields for "Name", "Email", and "Message", and a "Send Message" button. Make the form functional using a free service like Formspree or a similar alternative.

7.  Footer:
* A simple footer at the bottom of the page.
* It should contain the text: Â© 2025 [Your Name]. All Rights Reserved.
* Include the LinkedIn and GitHub social media icons again.

Final Instructions:

Ensure the entire website is fully responsive and looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Add subtle animations and transitions (e.g., fade-in effects for sections as you scroll, button hover effects) to make the website feel dynamic and modern.

Write clean, well-commented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code so I can easily edit and add my personal information later. Create separate files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
